System requirements:

System is strictly ran on php server, so therefore by downloading XAMPP, MAMP, or running LocalHost on your local terminal,
the php files will run from index, home, or even the profile page.

Personally, we used localhost in the running of this project

First, go into your command line prompt, and then go into the directory where all of the files of the project
are located
After reaching this directory:

For Mac (our specific OS) we ran the command: PHP -S localhost:8080, and after this command was processed
Go into your web browser and type in localhost:8080/index.php or /home.php or /profile.php etc. whichever php file 
you would like to access and the browser will take you to our page

^ That portion is for when the web server is down
Since it is not down
