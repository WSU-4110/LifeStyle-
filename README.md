Lifestyle Social media platform

**Our Product backlog can be found in issues**

LifeStyle is a Blockchain Social Media Platform that is based from Instagram. The main purpose of LifeStyle is to give our users control of the data they share and reward content creators.

LifeStyle is based off of our currency (LIFE) and of smart contracts with the coin Ethereum, and will allow content creators to get paid for the content they create, famous or anonymously.

The different functionalities that are instilled within LifeStyle are sending friend requests, creating and logging into an account, posting pictures and posts, gaining (LIFE) currency and transferring it to other users of interest, using the search bar to find different users via four different filters, and viewing other's profiles and showing support.
